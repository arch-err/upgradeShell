# UpgradeShell

# Description
UpgradeShell is a very small shellscript I made to automate the process of getting a full tty when you only have a crappy shell.
It was inspired by an article on the website [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/shells/full-ttys).

# Usage
This script is intended to be run from a launcher like dmenu or rofi


## Dependencies
 - xdotool

### Arch-based distributions
```bash
sudo pacman -S xdotool
```
### Debian-based distributions
```bash
sudo apt install xdotool
```
